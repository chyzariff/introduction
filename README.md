# Hi, I'm Bucky. If u want u can call me Riff if we're friends.
## Any prns // American (ENG only sry)

**WARNINGS + INFO:**
- Feel free to cuddle with me if I'm alone and don't have anything in my name stating otherwise (may include "iwec" on rare occasions)
- A lot of the time I'm offtab or at least unresponsive so don't be discouraged by that, I still appreciate people sitting near me
- I am sometimes paranoid or otherwise not okay. I will put "IWC" in my name if I am feeling unwell.
- If you try and int w/ me and I ignore you that's probably because I think you're trolling. Please say smth (if u can) or I might hide u on accident
- I am delusional. Sometimes I'm fine with doubles, sometimes I'm not. I hide people who use Bucky/Aizawa skins when I can't handle doubles (only for like 15m tho)
- Don't let what I've given warnings about discourage you from interacting. I'm not usually a rude or aloof person :P
- I am a system. I (Riff) am almost always fronting, and only one other alter is interested in ponytown (Jason Todd).
